Software Engineering Challenge

Requirements
Describe the challenge or problem, what does the program need to do
Create an animation of a cityscape that has two animations (one being a blinking window)
What classes/objects do you think you need? buildings, clouds, windows
How much time do you think you will you need to complete the project?
one weeks with 2-3 hours outside of class
Research
What knowledge or skills will you need to build this program
creating animations and graphics
Do you foresee any problems or constraints, describe
Yes, the positioning of all of the objects. 
Have you created a similar programs? Are there similar programs in the book or other resources? No
If so, what elements of that project can you bring to this project?
Do you have the resources you need to create the program? Yes
Do you need to learn any new knowledge or skill(s) to create the program?
No
Design
Draw/create a basic graphic you plan to build - attach the drawing
(paint, word, photo shop) not every objet (draw one example although there may be several in the final program) needs to be in the basic graphic
Include a task list--what will you need to do and in what order
Create the background 
sidewalk
sun
buildings
Animate

Estimate the amount of time you will need to complete each part the project
1st 4 parts - 1 week
2nd part - 1 week




Construction – included in summary doc
Document your construction progress with date and progress made (build a chart/table in word or excel), also, include at least three screen shots of your city (beginning, middle, and end)

Testing/Results/Delivery—summary doc not required to start project
Preliminary testing
Does your program meet the needs of the initial challenge or problem?  How do you know? 
Yes, there are blinking windows and changing clouds, which meets the requirements. 

Are any changes or modifications needed, why or why not?  Document any changes.
Summarize the project - what worked, what didn’t work, note your successes and/or failures.  

I decided to change the sky at the middle of the project to a sunset, but for some reason, the sky was animating even when I didn’t want it to. I decided to change the sky back to the original one. I think I did a good job with the building and window placement. I think that I should modify the windows more to blink more consistently. 

Looking back, would you have done anything differently, why or why not
Yes, I would’ve spent more time with the sunset background so I could get it to work. I didn’t have enough time left to work on this aspect of the cityscape.

Create background and buildings



Reshape buildings, add road, one more building, make a cloud, reshape the frame



Changed my mind - wanted a sunset instead of a moon. Added more clouds


Space out the clouds, add windows, and change the colors of the buildings

animate the clouds to get bigger and smaller and animate the blinking windows. 

The sunset sky wasn’t working, so I decided to change it back to the original sky. 

Also changed the position of the sun to be more realistic.
